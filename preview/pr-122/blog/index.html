      <p data-search="Discovering the beauty of math and the fun of computer scienceMy mother saw math in everything around us  in the geometry of a bridge we drove across  in the permutations of numbers that make up my birthday Growing up she would get excited as she explained the solution to a math problem She would tell me that math is beautiful As a high school student  I remember thinking that math was simply a graduation requirement However my understanding and appreciation for math soon changed After taking an applied mathematics course in college  Bryn Mawr College   I discovered how math paired with computer science could be used to model and solve real world problems such as predicting the spread of influenza virus through a population given different control measures such as antiviral drugs This course introduced me to mathematical concepts that allowed me to make quasi discoveries within a simplified dynamical system I found the beauty in math was combining it with computer science to translate science and research to clinical applications   It was exciting that I could make discoveries about seal populations with a few lines of code and some math equations I started to actively pursue opportunities to continue applying computational methods to science problems This eventually lead to me to start a graduate degree program in Genomics and Computational Biology at the University of Pennsylvania in 2017 In 2018  I joined Casey Greene s lab  which has a lot of expertise in using deep learning methods to study biology Despite having a computational background  I had a lot to learn about what deep learning was Additionally  my educational background was purely computational and so I also needed to learn biology   in my first graduate course I remember my first question was  what is a gene  After a long journey  I have published a paper using a generative multi layer neural network to simulate compendia of gene expression experiments from large scale microbial and human datasets I have contributed to a community written manuscript about tips for using deep learning in biology Overall  my dissertation research has focused on using deep learning methods to extract patterns from large scale gene expression datasets I am currently applying these methods to understand mechanisms of P aeruginosa infection My goal is to develop methods that help gain insight into the complexities of disease traits You can find my current research projects on my github page Deep learning in biology workshopTo celebrate and pass on the knowledge  my lab mate  Ben Heil and I are hosting a  Deep Learning for Biologists Workshop  For biologists with no computational background  we hope that after this course   You will have an idea of what deep learning is  You will be inspired to find applications of deep learning in your own researchFor those with some computational background  you will also gain an intuitive sense for how these methods work with a little bit of math  what else would you expect from a former math major  We know the idea of deep learning feels very daunting  but we know that you can learn this too Come join us Thursday  October 29 at 11am   2pm EST Registration can be found here                    ">

      <p data-search="ContextI m considering this question in regards to PhD programs in the biological sciences For a brief bit of context  these are programs where trainees  once they join a program  have their tuition paid for and also receive a stipend The funds to offer the stipend and tuition coverage primarily come from an institution  from training grants  which are given to an individual or institution to support training in areas of need   and from research project grants  which are given to an institution for the purposes of carrying out a specific research project  In short  the training program includes classwork  which is an investment that the institution makes in each student  as well as a research component  which involves the trainee carrying out a project that also benefits the institution What are the application fees When students want to apply to one of these programs  they are often required to pay a fee to have their application considered The fee to apply to our Genomics and Computational Biology  GCB  program for the 2019 class year was  80 This means that we raise from applicants  at most  see the bit on fee waivers below   about  16000 per year if we assume roughly 200 applications A student applying to 10 PhD programs would spend roughly  800 with the hopes of matriculating into one What are the arguments in favor of application fees I ve heard a few arguments for fees I can continue to add to this list if folks provide new reasons  mention  greenescientist on twitter or email greenescientist gmail com  If you want to add a reason  please keep it to a few sentences or provide a link to a twitter thread   blog post   something else that I can link to   It signifies that the applicant is seriously considering the program By paying the fee the student is essentially anteing up and saying they would be interested in attending the program if invited   It raises funds that can be used for purposes that would be otherwise difficult to cover on certain other sources of support  e g   beer at interview weekends    It does not create a barrier to anyone because domestic applicants can request fee waivers I am under the impression that the Penn Biomedical Graduate Studies  BGS  program policies are to grant waivers to any domestic applicant who requests one What are my concerns with application fees I worry that the fees present barriers for reasons that I ll detail below I can also continue to add to this list if folks provide new reasons  mention  greenescientist on twitter or email greenescientist gmail com  If you want to add a reason  please keep it to a few sentences or provide a link to a twitter thread   blog post   something else that I can link to   The barrier imposed by fees is unequally felt by students Students for whom  1000 is a negligible cost at the conclusion of their undergraduate careers may apply to many programs  increasing their likelihood of admission  while those for whom this is a major cost may apply to fewer programs Even with fee waivers  which seem to only apply to domestic students   students who face this hurdle and who do not realize they can ask for a fee waiver  who feel that asking for a fee waiver may reveal something that they do not wish to share  or who feel that asking for a fee waiver burdens a program may apply to fewer programs reducing their chances of admission   The amount of money that a program gains is not that substantial relative to other program expenses For our example of the Penn GCB program  applicants  fees provide about  16 000 in revenue per year However  the stipends alone for each entering class of roughly ten students run more than  300 000 per year Including the tuition  and the fact that the first two years are covered by institutional funds at Penn  each class of students for a ten person program must cost at least  650 000 before students are transitioned onto research grant support A more accurate number is probably   960 000  but I wanted to provide the most conservative estimate   Programs benefit from attracting the best possible set of matriculating students Students are engaged in both coursework and research Their research efforts directly benefit the institution Thus while it is true that students are competing for spots in each class  programs are also competing for students Admission to a PhD program can be quite difficult to predict and depends on certain factors related to the student  application strength as perceived by an admissions committee  but also factors beyond the control of the student  the composition of the rest of the applicant pool with respect to research interests and potential research advisors  It seems unfair and inefficient to penalize students for applying to programs that may initially seem like a reach What could the next steps be I have been made aware that at Penn we looked into the effect of application fees and little evidence was found that our fees were a barrier  I did look through the peer reviewed literature a bit  and I couldn t find data on the results of a complete elimination of application fees  I did find results that suggested that granting fee waivers as a matter of routine could be helpful  It seems that perhaps there isn t evidence simply because the experiment hasn t been done I hope that one or more graduate programs at an institution will run an experiment with the complete elimination of application fees  It is probably best  from an experimental design point of view  to eliminate fees for randomly selected set of programs while leaving other programs at the institution s application fee unchanged  Interesting outcomes to examine would include committee assigned scores for applicants invited to interview  the number of first generation  low income  and underrepresented minority scientists invited to interview  and the yield from the interview process  I had hoped that we would be able to run such an evaluation at Penn  but this will not come to pass I am posting this to the blog in the hopes that another institution will find the question to be worth asking Update 5 1 19 After posting  I was pointed to CMU s Department of Philosophy s elimination of application fees in 2017 ">

      <p data-search="TL DR  This twitter thread from Michael Hendricks is on the money In a recent article in Science about the National Academies developing a procedure to expel sexual harassers  Dr  Robert Weinberg  Member  Whitehead Institute  and Daniel K  Ludwig Professor for Cancer Research in the Department of Biology at MIT  was quoted as saying   Before there is a mad rush to approve such an ejection procedure  it might be useful to ask whether sexual harassment by a member has anything whatsoever to do with their credibility as a scientist and the soundness of their research accomplishments the criteria that were used to elect them in the first place  When scientists reach these milestones by imposing costs on others through falsification  harassment  or other means they are externalizing costs onto the rest of the field We shouldn t honor that We might be tempted to buy into a lone genius model of science In popular media  scientists are sometimes presented as brilliant folks who toil in isolation and only emerge when they have some deep  self evident insight that nobody can disagree with However  this model is a myth and nothing could be further from the truth Science is a messy  community based process The scientist toiling long hours in the lab has based work on the findings of others That scientist has had ideas honed by a mentor  feedback from others in the research group  and directly or indirectly by external peers For the work to be convincing and impactful  the scientist will need to rule out additional models raised by the community by performing more experiments The ultimate trajectory of a research program and its influence is shaped by others As soon as one leaves the lone genius myth behind  it is obvious why harassers should not be admitted to the National Academies and should be expelled if they already have been admitted Unfortunately  harassment is all too common in academia  with fifty eight percent of female faculty and staff in academia reporting behaviors that constitute harassment Scientists who are harassed have their time and attention unfairly taken from them They may leave one field and transition to another to escape their harasser s    requiring them to spend time gaining additional skills and knowledge   or even leave science entirely  see the NASEM report on Sexual Harassment of Women  Chapter 4  Those who support such scientists  for example Dr  BethAnn McLaughlin  founder of  MeTooSTEM  are also taxed for their own time and attention Too often  these may be ghost mentors who receive little or no credit for their efforts  Harassment taxes the harassed scientist s time  attention and resources  as well as those of other scientists It weakens the community  by promoting a homogeneity of experiences and backgrounds it reduces the effectiveness of scientific inquiry In short  it imposes the costs for the failings of the harasser on others Revisiting Dr  Weinberg s question of whether or not sexual harassment has anything to do with a perpetrator s credibility and research accomplishments  my answer is an emphatic  Yes  It s clear that the National Academies can be a force for good  see  for example  their own report on the impact of Sexual Harassment If the National Academies fail to pass this policy during the vote on April 30th  then they will have failed the scientific community Other organizations  for example the Wellcome Trusts  are moving ahead with policies to reduce harassment in science Every time that the National Academies fail to expel harassers  they look more like relics of a bygone age This diminishes the relevance of the Academies to the future of science and the honor associated with membership   Take Dr  McLaughlin for example  her work is more widely cited than mine  she s received more NIH funding than I have  in addition to other federal funding   and she s clearly had a larger impact on the practice of science than I have  AAAS and NAS among many others  It s clear that she is far more qualified to be a tenured faculty member than I am In a seemingly absurd decision  Vanderbilt denied her tenure case after the dean of VUMC  Jeffrey Balser  had her case reconsidered by a committee that included a faculty member now on leave for sexual misconduct  David Sweatt  The committee in question was overturning two initial favorable tenure decisions The Chancellor of Vanderbilt University  Nick Zeppos  has failed to support her tenure case  though he has published a blog post on the importance of women at Vanderbilt It conspicuously ignores Dr  McLaughlin  a winner of the MIT Disobedience Prize P S  I gave a talk at UAB recently  where I included some slides    a new bonus slide with Dr  Weinberg s quotation for a seminar I m giving at NYU on Monday  April 8  You are welcome to use them in your own talks  note the arrangement  which is my own  is CC0 licensed  but certain content is by others

        TL;DR: This twitter thread from Michael Hendricks is on the money.

      <p data-search="Brief ContextAs a scientist  I often attend conferences meetings etc Making this work as a childless  married academic husband was reasonably straightforward for my wife and me However  things changed in April of 2018 when our daughter was born Finding a way to integrate our daughter into this schedule is important because academic life bleeds heavily into times that are normally reserved for family life  weekends  evenings  Many academic conferences and events are scheduled over a weekend or involve weekend travel What works for us is that I will take the baby with me when I travel for trips where it makes sense for both of our schedules In our daughter s first six months  I traveled roughly 25 000 miles with her via air  car  and Amtrak Here I m compiling some observations from my travel that may be informative or helpful to others                     Visiting the Broad Institute on the first solo trip I took with our daughter  which we did via Amtrak       Travel SuppliesA good backpack beats a diaper bag I received an Aer Travel Pack 2 as a gift and used it as a travel backpack for some time before our daughter was born It was fine for that  but it makes a great travel diaper bag The features that I have found most important are that 1  electronics get stored in a separate  padded compartment  2  the separate  shoe compartment  can be used for soiled clothes  or diapers if you haven t found a place to dispose of them  wrapped in a plastic bag  3  it opens like a clamshell  so you can access different contents easily  I store diapers and wipes at the bottom  a couple changes of clothes above that  and then bottles  formula  and toys at the top  and 4  it fits under the seats of nearly all aircraft  there are a few aircraft types that have very narrow underseat storage for the aisle seat where it won t fit                      Napping on the Boppy pillow       Have a support for the baby on your lap I ve had good success with a Boppy pillow These things look like a huge neck pillow for the waist I ve found this helps with feeding  but it also gives our baby something to sleep on during the flight For me  it reduces the discomfort from having her on my lap for long stretches                     Everything s a toy  This cup was a big hit with me in Houston       Bring a few toys  but find a bunch more Our baby s philosophy seems to be that an object is just a toy she hasn t figured out how to have fun with yet Travel leads to lots of new objects We ve had fun with snack mix bags  plastic cups  spoons  and many other items I ve had good luck bringing a few toys and planning to find more along the way                     Car seat  stroller  Boppy in the walking through the airport configuration       My travel go to items for baby moving are an Ergobaby carrier  travel stroller  and car seat I like a travel stroller that the car seat gets attached to via a strap that goes where the seat belt would be In general  I use these as one would expect The best way I ve found to board a plane solo is to  a few minutes before boarding begins  put the baby into the ergobaby Wheel the stroller with the car seat inside down the ramp Fold the stroller and place both the stroller and the car seat at the end of the ramp for the ground crew For deplaning  I do this in reverse Finding a routine that works has helped me to keep everything together in some hectic situations The one caveat of going this route is to note that you need two gate check tags   one for the stroller and a second one for the car seat FeedingTraveling with formula was the best option for me I traveled with a cooler of breastmilk for the first trip I took with our baby  which was via Amtrak It dramatically increased how much I needed to carry  the logistics involved with timing  and meant that I needed to make absolutely sure that the hotel would have a suitably cold fridge  and freezer  on arrival It is something that is possible to do via train I only did this for the first trip  though I looked at what it would take to pack for travel via air and decided against for subsequent trips Formula is easier for me since I can easily pack it or buy it upon arrival Feed when the baby is hungry  and stay consistent in the size of the bottle For the first trips I had planned out when our baby would be hungry based on her normal schedule  and so I knew where I would be for each one Unfortunately  travel seems to alter babies eating schedules in unpredictable ways I tried to compensate by feeding an  interim  bottle that was half size to tide her over to the planned feeding time  but I have found this to be a path straight to a fussy baby and don t recommend it Whenever I find the perfect size cups  I ask for a few When I travel with room temperature formula and happen across paper cups for hot drinks that hold the bottle plus a roughly equal amount of water  I snag a few When I ask for water to heat up formula on a plane  I usually get near boiling water  when I use this water to heat formula  I let the water cool just a little bit  and then swirl the formula pretty quickly while it s warming   I didn t do this the first time  cooked the formula  and had to throw it out and start over  I ve found that with the rate of heat loss from such cups  equal amounts of formula and water is about the right size to get a suitably warm bottle of formula for our baby If the volume of the cup is too large the formula ends up too hot and I increase the risk of cooking it If it s too low  our baby won t drink it In Air and AirportFlights with a connection are better for longer itineraries When I traveled alone  I preferred the direct flight I ve found that when traveling with a baby  the opportunity to disembark  walk around a little bit  feed and change the baby in a less cramped space  and then continue to the destination is far more compatible with the happiness of me and our baby As a side benefit  these flights are often a bit cheaper than direct ones                     Snack mix bags crinkle  and wow that is fun       Airline club membership is helpful when traveling with an infant In 2017  I flew enough that I had complimentary access to Delta s Sky Clubs in 2018 The ability to take my stuff and baby in  set the stuff down  get a bite of food and some water  eat  feed the baby  change the baby  and get to the next flight made all of this far more pleasant                     Skyclub membership was helpful  This one in SLC let us put our stuff down and recharge mid itinerary       Certain aircraft do not have changing tables in the restrooms Delta flies a number of older aircraft  MD 88s  MD 90s  and 717s  and they use them heavily for flights to Philadelphia The existence of changing tables on these aircraft has been hit or miss If they do have changing tables  they re usually in one of the economy restrooms in the tail At least on Delta  you won t know this when you book   only when you look You probably want to check all three restrooms unless you are comfortable changing an infant who you are holding vertically I ve had to change three blowouts while holding our baby vertically in these aircraft without any tables It s something you get ok at I highly recommend traveling with the baby in either kimono style onesies or zippy jamz pajamas Anything that goes over the head is bad news for a standing blowout change                     Even as our daughter has grown  the Boppy pillow remains a favorite in the air       Ask for more cabin comfort The time that this most comes to mind for me was an early morning flight out of Houston s Hobby Airport We d gotten up around 4AM to catch a 6AM flight  and the aircraft was inordinately warm when we boarded My daughter actually did ok during the boarding process  but the flight continued to warm up on ascent My daughter started crying and was very difficult to console I thought the heat might be an issue  but it also could have been the early wake up or something else I waited until the drink service to ask if the cabin could be cooled down After service  the flight attendants must have asked the cockpit to reduce the temperature As soon as it started cooling down  she went to sleep and slept the rest of the flight If I d used the call button before service  I could have saved everyone a half hour of listening to a crying baby HotelsFor our baby at least  the first night in each new hotel room was a rough one I usually had at least a few wake ups at unusual times in addition to the usual ones I haven t found a solution to this  but at least I m now aware of what it ll be like Don t expect a crib in the room when you arrive I don t care how many times you call the hotel I don t care if it s the AAA four diamond rated Fairmont Orchid and you noted it on your reservation  confirmed again a week before  and confirmed at the desk when you checked in Do not expect it to be there Expect it to take at least an hour and three calls to the service desk after you arrive  at 10 PM Hawaii time after traveling from the east coast   I m still glaring at you Fairmont Orchid  We occasionally found the crib we had asked for  every time for our hotels in Japan  almost never anywhere else  But this seems to be something hotels in the US are more or less terrible at  so I d say just imagine it won t be there We did purchase a travel crib  which we have used when my wife and I have traveled together My daughter sleeps better in this  but the weight and added item makes it too cumbersome for me to take when it s just me Other Venue NotesSome places have been remarkably wonderful to work with In particular  the folks who scheduled the Annual Keck Center Research Conference for the Gulf Coast Consortia were incredible I was invited to speak at this event and initially declined because it was the day after a previously scheduled return flight from Japan After some discussion with the organizers  I decided to skip my final Detroit to Philadelphia leg and fly to Houston for the event before returning home While in Japan  we found it hard to get liquid formula that we d need for the Houston part of the trip When I asked for suggestions of a place to buy formula near the airport or hotel  the folks from the event put enough bottles of formula at the hotel check in that we were able to make it through the first night Then I just had to walk to a store to buy formula before the meeting the next day I also want to give a shout out to the folks from Northwestern Mutual s HQ in Milwaukee They hosted ALSF s Young Investigator Summit and made traveling with the baby a breeze                     Speaker dinner for the Keck Center Research Conference       Traveling with an infant may cost you some opportunities I was invited to give talks both during a symposium and for the community in my area of expertise at the University of Oslo that would have involved weekend travel When I asked the organizers to ask the hotel to add a crib to the room during the reservation process  this led to some red flags that ultimately led to the decision to find another speaker for their event and seminar series The advice that I ve gotten from folks on social media who traveled to work related seminars where they needed to take their kids was to not give organizers a heads up and to deal directly with the hotel for a crib If it s an opportunity you can t afford to miss  it sounds like this is still the way to go in 2018 However  if missing the event wouldn t be hugely costly  I ve found other places to be helpful and willing to ask the hotel for a crib when they make the reservation                     Our daughter spending lunch with me at PSB       Certain conferences and meetings also have very restrictive policies on children  so before you go it s probably good to see where your society falls I mentioned to a colleague that I would be at the American Association for Cancer Research  AACR  meeting with our daughter  and they mentioned that they had seen a scientist barred from the meeting because they were with a child It turns out that AACR bans children from exhibit halls  poster sessions  and scientific sessions at their annual meeting though it does provide a childcare option that might work for some The American Society for Clinical Oncology  ASCO  also bans children at their annual meeting and has not generally provided childcare for attendees In 2019 both of these meetings include a weekend  making the policies even more family unfriendly On the other hand  the American Society for Cell Biology  ASCB  has clear  inclusive policies during the meeting The Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing  PSB   a computational biology conference  has been family friendly for as long as I can remember The American Society for Human Genetics  ASHG  and International Society for Computational Biology  ISCB  get special shoutouts for both providing childcare options and allowing children at the meeting itself providing parents with the flexibility they need Closing thoughtsI ve enjoyed traveling with our daughter during this time For fathers who are considering traveling with their infants to a conference or symposium  I ve found that it is very practical to do so I would be remiss not to note that we give women traveling with a baby far less support than men There have been numerous situations throughout my time traveling that have made this clear to me On multiple flights  attendants have offered to hold my daughter if I needed to go to the restroom I haven t seen the same level of support for women traveling alone with their babies In one case  a flight attendant walked my daughter up and down the aisle of the aircraft to calm her Even fellow passengers seemed less irritated by a fussy infant with me  in all of this travel I can only think of one dirty look that I got from a fellow passenger while I was traveling alone with my daughter When you travel  offer assistance and understanding to women who need it as well           ">

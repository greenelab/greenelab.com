    "abstract": "Motivation: Large compendia of gene expression data have proven valuable for the discovery of novel biological relationships. The majority of available RNA assays are run on microarray, while RNA-seq is becoming the platform of choice for new experiments. The data structure and distributions between the platforms differ, making it challenging to combine them. We performed supervised and unsupervised machine learning evaluations, as well as differential expression analyses, to assess which normalization methods are best suited for combining microarray and RNA-seq data. Results: We find that quantile and Training Distribution Matching normalization allow for supervised and unsupervised model training on microarray and RNA-seq data simultaneously. Nonparanormal normalization and z-scores are also appropriate for some applications, including differential expression analysis. Availability and Implementation: These analyses were performed in R and are available at https://www.github.com/greenelab/RNAseq_titration_results under a BSD-3 clause license.",

    "abstract": "Bone accrual impacts lifelong skeletal health, but genetic discovery has been hampered by cross-sectional study designs and uncertainty about target effector genes. Here, we captured this dynamic phenotype by modeling longitudinal bone accrual across 11,000 bone scans followed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We revealed 40 loci (35 novel), half residing in topological associated domains harboring known bone genes. Several of these loci also associated with fracture risk later in life. Variant-to-gene mapping identified contacts between GWAS loci and nearby gene promoters, and siRNA knockdown of gene expression clarified the putative effector gene at three specific loci in two osteoblast cell models. The resulting target genes highlight the cell fate decision between osteogenic and adipogenic lineages as important in normal bone accrual.",

    "abstract": "Professional societies and their conferences provide an important venue for disseminating scientific knowledge. Delivering a keynote for or being named a fellow by an international society is a major recognition. Do such recognitions reflect the composition of the field of bioinformatics? We compiled a list of 412 honorees (75 fellows and 337 keynote speakers). To assess the composition of senior researchers in the field, we analyze the names and affliations of corresponding authors in leading bioinformatics journals. Comparing to the distribution based on names and affliations of honorees, we looked for disparities in gender, country of affliation, race, and name-origin. Name-origin predictions were created using a neural network trained on 700,000 name-nationality pairs mined from Wikipedia. The proportion of female honorees has kept pace with increasing levels of female authorship, but neither has yet to reach gender parity. However, we noticed a striking geographic disparity where the proportion of honorees with an affliation in the United States was 1.6-fold greater compared to field-specific senior authors. In total, we estimate the U.S. received 85 more honorees than would be expected from randomly selecting honorees from senior authors. Almost half of the excess in U.S. honorees was accounted for by a deficit of 41 honoree slots from China, France, and Italy. Furthermore, within the U.S., we identify racial disparities with an excess of white honorees and a depletion of Asian honorees. This pattern replicated globally, where we find names of East Asian origin have been persistently underrepresented among ISCB honorees. Early indications suggest the ICSB has taken note of our findings by selecting more diverse honorees.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs support multiple research efforts by providing contextual information for biomedical entities, constructing networks, and supporting the interpretation of high-throughput analyses. These databases are populated via some form of manual curation, which is difficult to scale in the context of an increasing publication rate. Data programming is a paradigm that circumvents this arduous manual process by combining databases with simple rules and heuristics written as label functions, which are programs designed to automatically annotate textual data. Unfortunately, writing a useful label function requires substantial error analysis and is a nontrivial task that takes multiple days per function. This makes populating a knowledge graph with multiple nodes and edge types practically infeasible. We sought to accelerate the label function creation process by evaluating the extent to which label functions could be re-used across multiple edge types. We used a subset of an existing knowledge graph centered on disease, compound, and gene entities to evaluate label function re-use. We determined the best label function combination by comparing a baseline database-only model with the same model but added edge-specific or edge-mismatch label functions. We confirmed that adding additional edge-specific rather than edge-mismatch label functions often improves text annotation and shows that this approach can incorporate novel edges into our source knowledge graph. We expect that continued development of this strategy has the potential to swiftly populate knowledge graphs with new discoveries, ensuring that these resources include cutting-edge results.",

    "abstract": "Rare genetic variation is abundant in the human genome, yet identifying functional rare variants and their impact on traits remains challenging. Measuring aberrant gene expression has aided in identifying functional, large-effect rare variants. Here, we expand detection of genetically driven transcriptome abnormalities by evaluating and integrating gene expression, allele-specific expression, and alternative splicing from multi-tissue RNA-sequencing data. We demonstrate that each signal informs unique classes of rare variants. We further develop Watershed, a probabilistic model that integrates multiple genomic and transcriptomic signals to predict variant function. Assessing rare variants prioritized by Watershed in the UK Biobank and Million Veterans Program, we identify large effects across 34 traits, and 33 rare variant-trait combinations with both high Watershed scores and large trait effect sizes. Together, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptomic impact of rare variation and a framework to prioritize functional rare variants and assess their trait relevance.",

Here, we present analyses of the v8 data, based on 17,382 RNA-sequencing samples from 54 tissues of 948 post-mortem donors. We comprehensively characterize genetic associations for gene expression and splicing in and , showing that regulatory associations are found for almost all genes, and describe the underlying molecular mechanisms and their contribution to allelic heterogeneity and pleiotropy of complex traits.

However, it is still a major challenge to distinguish functional lncRNAs from those that are byproducts of surrounding transcriptional activity. To systematically identify hallmarks of biological function, we used the GTEx v8 data to profile the expression, regulation, network relationships and trait associations of lncRNA genes across 49 tissues encompassing 87 distinct traits. In addition to revealing widespread differences in regulatory patterns between lncRNA and protein-coding genes, we identified novel disease-associated lncRNAs, such as for psoriasis and / for ulcerative colitis.

Here, we present an in-depth examination of the phenotypic consequences of transcriptome regulation and a blueprint for the functional interpretation of genetic loci discovered by Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). Across a broad set of complex traits and diseases, we find widespread dose-dependent effects of RNA expression and splicing, with higher impact on molecular phenotypes translating into higher impact downstream. Using colocalization and association approaches that take into account the observed allelic heterogeneity, we propose potential target genes for 47% (2,519 out of 5,385) of the GWAS loci examined. Our results demonstrate the translational relevance of the GTEx resources and highlight the need to increase their resolution and breadth to further our understanding of the genotype-phenotype link.",

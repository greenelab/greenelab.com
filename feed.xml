<p>My mother saw math in everything around us; in the geometry of a bridge we drove across, in the permutations of numbers that make up my birthday.
Growing up she would get excited as she explained the solution to a math problem.
She would tell me that <em>math is beautiful</em>.
As a high school student, I remember thinking that math was simply a graduation requirement.
However my understanding and appreciation for math soon changed.
After taking an applied mathematics course in college (Bryn Mawr College), I discovered how math paired with computer science could be used to model and solve real world problems such as predicting the spread of influenza virus through a population given different control measures such as antiviral drugs.
This course introduced me to mathematical concepts that allowed me to make quasi-discoveries within a simplified dynamical system.
I found the beauty in math was combining it with computer science to translate science and research to clinical applications – It was exciting that I could make discoveries about seal populations with a few lines of code and some math equations!</p>

<p>I started to actively pursue opportunities to continue applying computational methods to science problems.
This eventually lead to me to start a graduate degree program in Genomics and Computational Biology at the University of Pennsylvania in 2017.
In 2018, I joined Casey Greene’s lab, which has a lot of expertise in using deep learning methods to study biology.
Despite having a computational background, I had a lot to learn about what deep learning was.
Additionally, my educational background was purely computational and so I also needed to learn biology – in my first graduate course I remember my first question was “what is a gene?”</p>

<p>After a long journey, I have published a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.066597v1">paper</a> using a generative multi-layer neural network to simulate compendia of gene expression experiments from large-scale microbial and human datasets.
I have contributed to a community-written <a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules">manuscript</a> about tips for using deep learning in biology.
Overall, my dissertation research has focused on using deep learning methods to extract patterns from large-scale gene expression datasets.
I am currently applying these methods to understand mechanisms of <em>P.aeruginosa</em> infection.
My goal is to develop methods that help gain insight into the complexities of disease traits.

<p>To celebrate and pass on the knowledge, my lab mate, <a href="https://ben-heil.github.io/">Ben Heil</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/localee_compact">I</a> are hosting a <a href="https://ben-heil.github.io/2020-10-08-workshop/">“Deep Learning for Biologists Workshop”</a>.</p>

<p>For biologists with no computational background, we hope that after this course:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You will have an idea of what deep learning is</li>
  <li>You will be inspired to find applications of deep learning in your own research</li>
</ol>

<p>For those with some computational background, you will also gain an intuitive sense for how these methods work with a little bit of math (what else would you expect from a former math major).</p>

<p>We know the idea of deep learning feels very daunting, but we know that you can learn this too!</p>

<p>I’m considering this question in regards to PhD programs in the biological sciences.
For a brief bit of context, these are programs where trainees, once they join a program, have their tuition paid for and also receive a stipend.
The funds to offer the stipend and tuition coverage primarily come from an institution, from training grants (which are given to an individual or institution to support training in areas of need), and from research project grants (which are given to an institution for the purposes of carrying out a specific research project).
In short, the training program includes classwork, which is an investment that the institution makes in each student, as well as a research component, which involves the trainee carrying out a project that also benefits the institution.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-application-fees">What are the application fees?</h2>

<p>When students want to apply to one of these programs, they are often required to pay a fee to have their application considered.
The fee to apply to our Genomics and Computational Biology (GCB) program for the 2019 class year was $80.
This means that we raise from applicants, at most (see the bit on fee waivers below), about $16000 per year if we assume roughly 200 applications.
A student applying to 10 PhD programs would spend roughly $800 with the hopes of matriculating into one.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-arguments-in-favor-of-application-fees">What are the arguments in favor of application fees?</h2>

<p>I’ve heard a few arguments for fees.
I can continue to add to this list if folks provide new reasons (mention @greenescientist on twitter or email greenescientist@gmail.com).
If you want to add a reason, please keep it to a few sentences or provide a link to a twitter thread / blog post / something else that I can link to.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It signifies that the applicant is seriously considering the program.
By paying the fee the student is essentially anteing up and saying they would be interested in attending the program if invited.</li>
  <li>It raises funds that can be used for purposes that would be otherwise difficult to cover on certain other sources of support (e.g., beer at interview weekends).</li>
  <li>It does not create a barrier to anyone because domestic applicants can request fee waivers.
I am under the impression that the Penn Biomedical Graduate Studies (BGS) program policies are to grant waivers to any domestic applicant who <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/bgs/applicants_phd_faq.shtml#fee_waiver">requests one</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-my-concerns-with-application-fees">What are my concerns with application fees?</h2>

<p>I worry that the fees present barriers for reasons that I’ll detail below.
I can also continue to add to this list if folks provide new reasons (mention @greenescientist on twitter or email greenescientist@gmail.com).
If you want to add a reason, please keep it to a few sentences or provide a link to a twitter thread / blog post / something else that I can link to.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The barrier imposed by fees is unequally felt by students.
Students for whom $1000 is a negligible cost at the conclusion of their undergraduate careers may apply to many programs, increasing their likelihood of admission, while those for whom this is a major cost may apply to fewer programs.
Even with fee waivers (<a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/bgs/applicants_phd_faq.shtml#fee_waiver">which seem to only apply to domestic students</a>), students who face this hurdle and who do not realize they can ask for a fee waiver, who feel that asking for a fee waiver may reveal something that they do not wish to share, or who feel that asking for a fee waiver burdens a program may apply to fewer programs reducing their chances of admission.</li>
  <li>The amount of money that a program gains is not that substantial relative to other program expenses.
For our example of the Penn GCB program, applicants’ fees provide about $16,000 in revenue per year.
However, the stipends alone for each entering class of roughly ten students run more than $300,000 per year.
Including the tuition, and the fact that the first two years are covered by institutional funds at Penn, each class of students for a ten-person program must cost at least $650,000 before students are transitioned onto research grant support.
A more accurate number is probably ~$960,000, but I wanted to provide the most conservative estimate.</li>
  <li>Programs benefit from attracting the best possible set of matriculating students.
Students are engaged in both coursework and research.
Their research efforts directly benefit the institution.
Thus while it is true that students are competing for spots in each class, programs are also competing for students.
Admission to a PhD program can be quite difficult to predict and depends on certain factors related to the student (application strength as perceived by an admissions committee) but also factors beyond the control of the student (the composition of the rest of the applicant pool with respect to research interests and potential research advisors).
It seems unfair and inefficient to penalize students for applying to programs that may initially seem like a reach.</li>
</ul>

<p>What could the next steps be?</p>

<p>I have been made aware that at Penn we looked into the effect of application fees and little evidence was found that our fees were a barrier. I did look through the peer-reviewed literature a bit, and I couldn’t find data on the results of a complete elimination of application fees. I did find results that suggested that <a href="https://www.lifescied.org/doi/full/10.1187/cbe.17-09-0210">granting fee waivers as a matter of routine could be helpful</a>. It seems that perhaps there isn’t evidence simply because the experiment hasn’t been done.</p>

<p>I hope that one or more graduate programs at an institution will run an experiment with the complete elimination of application fees. It is probably best, from an experimental design point of view, to eliminate fees for randomly selected set of programs while leaving other programs at the institution’s application fee unchanged. Interesting outcomes to examine would include committee-assigned scores for applicants invited to interview; the number of first generation, low income, and underrepresented minority scientists invited to interview; and the yield from the interview process. I had hoped that we would be able to run such an evaluation at Penn, but this will not come to pass.
I am posting this to the blog in the hopes that another institution will find the question to be worth asking.</p>

<p>In a recent article in Science about the National Academies developing a procedure to expel sexual harassers, Dr. Robert Weinberg (<a href="https://biology.mit.edu/profile/robert-a-weinberg/">Member, Whitehead Institute; and Daniel K. Ludwig Professor for Cancer Research in the Department of Biology at MIT</a>) was quoted as saying, “Before there is a mad rush to approve such an ejection procedure, it might be useful to ask whether sexual harassment by a member has anything whatsoever to do with their credibility as a scientist and the soundness of their research accomplishments—the criteria that were used to elect them in the first place.”
When scientists reach these milestones by imposing costs on others through falsification, harassment, or other means they are externalizing costs onto the rest of the field.
We shouldn’t honor that.</p>

<p>We might be tempted to buy into a lone genius model of science.
In popular media, scientists are sometimes presented as brilliant folks who toil in isolation and only emerge when they have some deep, self-evident insight that nobody can disagree with.
However, this model is a myth and nothing could be further from the truth.
Science is a messy, community-based process.
The scientist toiling long hours in the lab has based work on the findings of others.
That scientist has had ideas honed by a mentor, feedback from others in the research group, and directly or indirectly by external peers.
For the work to be convincing and impactful, the scientist will need to rule out additional models raised by the community by performing more experiments.
The ultimate trajectory of a research program and its influence is shaped by others.</p>

<p>As soon as one leaves the lone genius myth behind, it is obvious why harassers should not be admitted to the National Academies and should be expelled if they already have been admitted.
Unfortunately, harassment is all too common in academia, with <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1744-6570.2003.tb00752.x">fifty-eight percent of female faculty and staff in academia reporting behaviors that constitute harassment</a>.
Scientists who are harassed have their time and attention unfairly taken from them.
They may leave one field and transition to another to escape their harasser(s) – requiring them to spend time gaining additional skills and knowledge – or even leave science entirely (see <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24994/sexual-harassment-of-women-climate-culture-and-consequences-in-academic">the NASEM report on Sexual Harassment of Women, Chapter 4</a>).
Those who support such scientists (for example Dr. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/neuroscientist-fighting-sexual-harassment-science-her-own-job-peril">BethAnn</a> <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/This-Scientist-Was-the/245806">McLaughlin</a>, founder of #MeTooSTEM) are also taxed for their own time and attention.
Too often, these may be ghost mentors who receive little or no credit for their efforts.*</p>

<p>Harassment taxes the harassed scientist’s time, attention and resources, as well as those of other scientists.
It weakens the community: by promoting a homogeneity of experiences and backgrounds it reduces the effectiveness of scientific inquiry.
In short, it imposes the costs for the failings of the harasser on others.
Revisiting Dr. Weinberg’s question of whether or not sexual harassment has anything to do with a perpetrator’s credibility and research accomplishments, my answer is an emphatic “Yes!”</p>

<p>It’s clear that the National Academies can be a force for good: see, for example, <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24994/sexual-harassment-of-women-climate-culture-and-consequences-in-academic">their own report on the impact of Sexual Harassment</a>.
If the National Academies fail to pass this policy during the vote on April 30th, then they will have failed the scientific community.
Other organizations, <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/guidance/policy-bullying-and-harassment">for example the Wellcome Trusts</a>, are moving ahead with policies to reduce harassment in science.
Every time that the National Academies fail to expel harassers, they look more like relics of a bygone age.
This diminishes the relevance of the Academies to the future of science and the honor associated with membership.</p>

<p>* Take Dr. McLaughlin for example: her work is <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hPq2CqAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">more widely cited than mine</a>, she’s received <a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/Reporter_Viewsh.cfm?sl=15EDC9094A89C4D77598B8961CAA4A01A2FFCEB861BF">more NIH funding than I have</a> (in addition to other federal funding), and she’s clearly had a larger impact on the practice of science than I have (<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6408/1175">AAAS</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/04/national-academy-sciences-will-vote-ejecting-sexual-harassers">NAS</a> among many others).
It’s clear that she is far more qualified to be a tenured faculty member than I am.
In a seemingly absurd decision, Vanderbilt denied her tenure case after <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/21789/campus/metoo-stem-founder-dr-bethann-mclaughlin-is-fighting-for-tenure-at-vanderbilt/">the dean of VUMC, Jeffrey Balser, had her case reconsidered by a committee that included a faculty member now on leave for sexual misconduct</a> (<a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/vanderbilt-professor-on-leave-after-sexual-assault-allegations--65032">David Sweatt</a>).
The committee in question was overturning two initial favorable tenure decisions.
The Chancellor of Vanderbilt University, Nick Zeppos, has failed to support her tenure case, though he has <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2019/03/25/whats-on-my-mind-celebrating-womens-history-and-impact/">published a blog post on the importance of women at Vanderbilt</a>.
It conspicuously ignores Dr. McLaughlin, a <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/media-lab-disobedience-award-winners-announced-1128">winner of the MIT Disobedience Prize</a>.</p>

<p>P.S. I gave a talk at UAB recently, where I <a href="https://upenn.box.com/s/hqnry3kd75hg5upjml2z82g4bocgbb9z">included some slides</a> (+ a new bonus slide with Dr. Weinberg’s quotation for a seminar I’m giving at NYU on Monday, April 8).

<p>As a scientist, I often attend conferences/meetings/etc.
Making this work as a childless, married academic husband was reasonably straightforward for my wife and me.
However, things changed in April of 2018 when our daughter was born.
Finding a way to integrate our daughter into this schedule is important because academic life bleeds heavily into times that are normally reserved for family life (weekends, evenings).
Many academic conferences and events are scheduled over a weekend or involve weekend travel.
What works for us is that I will take the baby with me when I travel for trips where it makes sense for both of our schedules.
In our daughter’s first six months, I traveled roughly 25,000 miles with her via air, car, and Amtrak.
Here I’m compiling some observations from my travel that may be informative or helpful to others.</p>

<p><strong>A good backpack beats a diaper bag.</strong>
I received an <a href="https://www.aersf.com/travel-pack-2-black/">Aer Travel Pack 2</a> as a gift and used it as a travel backpack for some time before our daughter was born.
It was fine for that, but it makes a great travel diaper bag.
The features that I have found most important are that 1) electronics get stored in a separate, padded compartment; 2) the separate “shoe compartment” can be used for soiled clothes (or diapers if you haven’t found a place to dispose of them) wrapped in a plastic bag; 3) it opens like a clamshell, so you can access different contents easily: I store diapers and wipes at the bottom, a couple changes of clothes above that, and then bottles, formula, and toys at the top; and 4) it fits under the seats of nearly all aircraft (there are a few aircraft types that have very narrow underseat storage for the aisle seat where it won’t fit).</p>

<p><strong>Have a support for the baby on your lap.</strong>
I’ve had good success with a <a href="https://www.boppy.com/nursing-pillows/">Boppy pillow</a>.
These things look like a huge neck pillow for the waist.
I’ve found this helps with feeding, but it also gives our baby something to sleep on during the flight.
For me, it reduces the discomfort from having her on my lap for long stretches.</p>

<p><strong>Bring a few toys, but find a bunch more.</strong>
Our baby’s philosophy seems to be that an object is just a toy she hasn’t figured out how to have fun with yet.
Travel leads to lots of new objects.
We’ve had fun with snack mix bags, plastic cups, spoons, and many other items.
I’ve had good luck bringing a few toys and planning to find more along the way.</p>

<p><strong>My travel go-to items for baby moving are an Ergobaby carrier, travel stroller, and car seat.</strong>
I like a travel stroller that the car seat gets attached to via a strap that goes where the seat belt would be.
In general, I use these as one would expect.
The best way I’ve found to board a plane solo is to, a few minutes before boarding begins, put the baby into the ergobaby.
Wheel the stroller with the car seat inside down the ramp.
Fold the stroller and place both the stroller and the car seat at the end of the ramp for the ground crew.
For deplaning, I do this in reverse.
Finding a routine that works has helped me to keep everything together in some hectic situations.
The one caveat of going this route is to note that you need two gate-check tags - one for the stroller and a second one for the car seat.</p>

<h2 id="feeding">Feeding</h2>

<p><strong>Traveling with formula was the best option for me.</strong>
I traveled with a cooler of breastmilk for the first trip I took with our baby, which was via Amtrak.
It dramatically increased how much I needed to carry, the logistics involved with timing, and meant that I needed to make absolutely sure that the hotel would have a suitably cold fridge (and freezer) on arrival.
It is something that is possible to do via train.
I only did this for the first trip, though I looked at what it would take to pack for travel via air and decided against for subsequent trips.
Formula is easier for me since I can easily pack it or buy it upon arrival.</p>

<p><strong>Feed when the baby is hungry, and stay consistent in the size of the bottle.</strong>
For the first trips I had planned out when our baby would be hungry based on her normal schedule, and so I knew where I would be for each one.
Unfortunately, travel seems to alter babies eating schedules in unpredictable ways.
I tried to compensate by feeding an “interim” bottle that was half-size to tide her over to the planned feeding time, but I have found this to be a path straight to a fussy baby and don’t recommend it.</p>

<p><strong>Whenever I find the perfect size cups, I ask for a few.</strong>
When I travel with room-temperature formula and happen across paper cups for hot drinks that hold the bottle plus a roughly equal amount of water, I snag a few.
When I ask for water to heat up formula on a plane, I usually get near-boiling water (when I use this water to heat formula, I let the water cool just a little bit, and then swirl the formula pretty quickly while it’s warming - I didn’t do this the first time, cooked the formula, and had to throw it out and start over).
I’ve found that with the rate of heat loss from such cups, equal amounts of formula and water is about the right size to get a suitably warm bottle of formula for our baby.
If the volume of the cup is too large the formula ends up too hot and I increase the risk of cooking it.
If it’s too low, our baby won’t drink it.</p>

<p><strong>Flights with a connection are better for longer itineraries.</strong>
When I traveled alone, I preferred the direct flight.
I’ve found that when traveling with a baby, the opportunity to disembark, walk around a little bit, feed and change the baby in a less cramped space, and then continue to the destination is far more compatible with the happiness of me and our baby.
As a side benefit, these flights are often a bit cheaper than direct ones.</p>

<p><strong>Airline club membership is helpful when traveling with an infant.</strong>
In 2017, I flew enough that I had complimentary access to Delta’s Sky Clubs in 2018.
The ability to take my stuff and baby in, set the stuff down, get a bite of food and some water, eat, feed the baby, change the baby, and get to the next flight made all of this far more pleasant.</p>

<p><strong>Certain aircraft do not have changing tables in the restrooms.</strong>
Delta flies a number of older aircraft (MD-88s, MD-90s, and 717s) and they use them heavily for flights to Philadelphia.
The existence of changing tables on these aircraft has been hit or miss.
If they do have changing tables, they’re usually in one of the economy restrooms in the tail.
At least on Delta, you won’t know this when you book - only when you look.
You probably want to check all three restrooms unless you are comfortable changing an infant who you are holding vertically.
I’ve had to change three blowouts while holding our baby vertically in these aircraft without any tables.
It’s something you get ok at.
I highly recommend traveling with the baby in either kimono-style onesies or zippy jamz pajamas.
Anything that goes over the head is bad news for a standing blowout change.</p>

<p><strong>Ask for more cabin comfort.</strong>
The time that this most comes to mind for me was an early morning flight out of Houston’s Hobby Airport.
We’d gotten up around 4AM to catch a 6AM flight, and the aircraft was inordinately warm when we boarded.
My daughter actually did ok during the boarding process, but the flight continued to warm up on ascent.
My daughter started crying and was very difficult to console.
I thought the heat might be an issue, but it also could have been the early wake-up or something else.
I waited until the drink service to ask if the cabin could be cooled down.
After service, the flight attendants must have asked the cockpit to reduce the temperature.
As soon as it started cooling down, she went to sleep and slept the rest of the flight.
If I’d used the call button before service, I could have saved everyone a half-hour of listening to a crying baby.</p>

<h2 id="hotels">Hotels</h2>

<p><strong>For our baby at least, the first night in each new hotel room was a rough one.</strong>
I usually had at least a few wake-ups at unusual times in addition to the usual ones.
I haven’t found a solution to this, but at least I’m now aware of what it’ll be like.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t expect a crib in the room when you arrive.</strong>
I don’t care how many times you call the hotel.
I don’t care if it’s the AAA four-diamond rated Fairmont Orchid and you noted it on your reservation, confirmed again a week before, and confirmed at the desk when you checked in.
Do not expect it to be there.
Expect it to take at least an hour and three calls to the service desk after you arrive (at 10 PM Hawaii time after traveling from the east coast - I’m still glaring at you Fairmont Orchid).
We occasionally found the crib we had asked for (every time for our hotels in Japan, almost never anywhere else).
But this seems to be something hotels in the US are more or less terrible at, so I’d say just imagine it won’t be there.
We did purchase <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Lotus-Travel-Crib-Lightweight-Comfortable/dp/B00AKKDSNG?sa-no-redirect=1">a travel crib</a>, which we have used when my wife and I have traveled together.
My daughter sleeps better in this, but the weight and added item makes it too cumbersome for me to take when it’s just me.</p>

<h2 id="other-venue-notes">Other Venue Notes</h2>

<p><strong>Some places have been remarkably wonderful to work with.</strong>
In particular, the folks who scheduled the <a href="http://www.gulfcoastconsortia.org/home/training/28th-annual-keck-center-research-conference/">Annual Keck Center Research Conference for the Gulf Coast Consortia</a> were incredible.
I was invited to speak at this event and initially declined because it was the day after a previously-scheduled return flight from Japan.
After some discussion with the organizers, I decided to skip my final Detroit to Philadelphia leg and fly to Houston for the event before returning home.
While in Japan, we found it hard to get liquid formula that we’d need for the Houston part of the trip.
When I asked for suggestions of a place to buy formula near the airport or hotel, the folks from the event put enough bottles of formula at the hotel check-in that we were able to make it through the first night.
Then I just had to walk to a store to buy formula before the meeting the next day.
I also want to give a shout out to the folks from <a href="https://www.northwesternmutual.com/">Northwestern Mutual’s HQ</a> in Milwaukee.
They hosted <a href="https://www.alexslemonade.org/young-investigator-summit">ALSF’s Young Investigator Summit</a> and made traveling with the baby a breeze.</p>

<p><strong>Traveling with an infant may cost you some opportunities.</strong>
I was invited to give talks both during a symposium and for the community in my area of expertise at the <a href="https://www.uio.no/english/">University of Oslo</a> that would have involved weekend travel.
When I asked the organizers to ask the hotel to add a crib to the room during the reservation process, this led to some red flags that ultimately led to the decision to find another speaker for their event and seminar series.
The advice that I’ve gotten from folks on social media who traveled to work-related seminars where they needed to take their kids was to not give organizers a heads up and to deal directly with the hotel for a crib.
If it’s an opportunity you can’t afford to miss, it sounds like this is still the way to go in 2018.
However, if missing the event wouldn’t be hugely costly, I’ve found other places to be helpful and willing to ask the hotel for a crib when they make the reservation.</p>

<p><strong>Certain conferences and meetings also have very restrictive policies on children, so before you go it’s probably good to see where your society falls.</strong>
I mentioned to a colleague that I would be at the <a href="https://www.aacr.org/MEETINGS/PAGES/GENERAL-INFORMATION-AND-FREQUENTLY-ASKED-QUESTIONS___F7E4E4.ASPX#code">American Association for Cancer Research (AACR)</a> meeting with our daughter, and they mentioned that they had seen a scientist barred from the meeting because they were with a child.
It turns out that AACR bans children from exhibit halls, poster sessions, and scientific sessions at their annual meeting though it does provide a childcare option that might work for some.
The <a href="https://www.asco.org/sites/new-www.asco.org/files/content-files/about-asco/pdf/ASCO-Meeting-Attendee-Policies.pdf">American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO)</a> also bans children at their annual meeting and has not generally provided childcare for attendees.
In 2019 both of these meetings include a weekend, making the policies even more family-unfriendly.
On the other hand, the <a href="https://ascb-embo2018.ascb.org/meetingpoliciesandchildren/">American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB)</a> has clear, inclusive policies during the meeting.
<a href="http://psb.stanford.edu/">The Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB)</a>, a computational biology conference, has been family friendly for as long as I can remember.
<a href="https://www.ashg.org/2017meeting/pages/general.shtml">The American Society for Human Genetics (ASHG)</a> and <a href="https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2019-general/faq#childrenallowed">International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB)</a> get special shoutouts for both providing childcare options and allowing children at the meeting itself providing parents with the flexibility they need.</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>

<p>I’ve enjoyed traveling with our daughter during this time.
For fathers who are considering traveling with their infants to a conference or symposium, I’ve found that it is very practical to do so.
I would be remiss not to note that we give women traveling with a baby far less support than men.
There have been numerous situations throughout my time traveling that have made this clear to me.
On multiple flights, attendants have offered to hold my daughter if I needed to go to the restroom.
I haven’t seen the same level of support for women traveling alone with their babies.
In one case, a flight attendant walked my daughter up and down the aisle of the aircraft to calm her.
Even fellow passengers seemed less irritated by a fussy infant with me: in all of this travel I can only think of one dirty look that I got from a fellow passenger while I was traveling alone with my daughter.
When you travel, offer assistance and understanding to women who need it as well.</p>

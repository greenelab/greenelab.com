Natalie is a postdoctoral researcher who joined the GreeneLab in 2020.
She received her PhD in Computational Biology and Medicine in 2019 from the Tri-Institutional Program for Computational Biology and Medicine in New York while conducting research at ETH Zürich's [Biomedical Informatics Lab](https://bmi.inf.ethz.ch/).
During her PhD, she participated in the [International Cancer Genome Consortium](http://icgc.org/) where she performed integrative analyses across multiple transcriptional aberrations to identify cancer relevant genes and alteration patterns.

Building upon her previous experience in analyzing large cancer cohorts, she aims to leverage freely availble datasets and integrate them with single-patient -omic data to help guide precision oncology.

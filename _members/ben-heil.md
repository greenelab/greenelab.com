Ben was a PhD student in the [Genomics and Computational Biology program at Penn](http://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/) who defended his thesis in Dec. 2022.
Previously he graduated from Baylor University with a degree in bioinformatics in 2018, and joined the Greene lab in the summer of 2019.
Ben's research focuses on using transfer learning to gain insight from large gene expression datasets.
Outside of school, Ben is a mostly retired swimmer, a bass singer, and a person who can talk for hours about the collected works of Patrick Rothfuss.
He also operates a blog, [AutoBenCoding](https://autobencoder.com), that talks about machine learning, reproducible research, and other sciency things.
